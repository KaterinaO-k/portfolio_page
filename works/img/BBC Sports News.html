                <h2>Hard to see fans returning to football soon - FA chairman</h2>
                <p>Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has said it is hard to see fans returning to matches "any
                    time soon". If the Premier League and Football League seasons resume, those matches will be played
                    behind closed doors.

                    The Premier League is also preparing for the possibility of playing the 2020-21 season without fans.

                    "The reality is that we just don't know how things are going to pan out," Clarke wrote in a letter
                    to the FA governing council.

                    "But with social distancing in place for some time to come we do face substantial changes to the
                    whole football ecosystem.

                    "For example it's hard to foresee crowds of fans - who are the lifeblood of the game - returning to
                    matches any time soon."

                    Clarke warned of an FA budget cut of £75m this year, with a "worst-case scenario" of a £300m deficit
                    over the next four years impacting "every area of the game".</p>

                <p>
                    Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius says he has "terminated" his two-year loan deal at Turkish side
                    Besiktas.

                    The 26-year-old was in the second year of his spell in Istanbul and had made 30 appearances before
                    the season was stopped because of coronavirus.

                    Karius said on Instagram it was a "shame it comes to an end like this". </p>

                    It's too early to even talk about the Italian football season restarting, according to sports
                    minister Vincenzo Spadafora.

                    Serie A clubs have been given permission to restart individual training sessions from Monday at
                    training grounds.

                    But team training will not be allowed until 18 May at the earliest.</p>
